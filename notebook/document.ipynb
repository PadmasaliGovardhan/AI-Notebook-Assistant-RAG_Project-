The 8051 timers have three general \\nfunctions:  \\n1) Keeping time and/or calculating the amount of time between \\nevents (interval timing mode) \\n2) Counting the events themselves (event counting mode) \\n3) Generating baud rates for the serial port  \\nThe first two uses will be discussed in this handout while the use of \\ntimers for baud rate generation will be considered in the handout \\nrelated to serial ports. \\n8051 Timers Operation \\nA timer counts up when incremented by the microcontroller or some \\nexternal source. When the timer reaches the maximum value and is \\nsubsequently incremented, it will reset- or overflow -back to 0. This will \\nalso set the timer overflow flag in one of timer SFRs. \\nWhen a timer is in interval timer mode (as opposed to event counter \\nmode) and correctly configured, it will increment by 1 every machine \\ncycle. If the machine cycle consists of 6 crystal pulses a timer running \\non the microcontroller with 11.0592 MHz crystal will be incremented \\n1843200 times per second since: \\n \\n6\\n11.0592 10\\n1843200\\n6\\n×\\n=\\n \\n \\nThis means that if the timer has counted from 0 to 100000 a 0.05425 \\nseconds or 54.25 milliseconds have passed since: \\n \\n100000\\n0.05425\\n1843200 =\\n \\n \\nA reverse calculation can also be made, so if for example, we want to \\nknow how many times timer needs to increment during 20 milliseconds \\nwe need to perform following calculation: \\n \\n0.02 1843200=36864\\n×\\n \\n \\nIt is therefore necessary to have exactly 36864 timer increments to \\nachieve a time period of 20 milliseconds. This is actually a way to \\nmeasure time using timers on the microcontroller – by counting the \\nnumber of timer increments during the measured time period. All that is \\nnow needed is to learn how to control and initialise timers to provide the \\nneeded information. This is done through the proper setting of a \\nnumber of SFRs related to timer functions and explained in following \\nsections of this document. \\nTimer Registers \\nTwo 8051 timers are called Timer0 and Timer1 and they share two \\nSFRs (TMOD and TCON) which control the timers, and each timer also \\nhas two SFRs dedicated solely to itself (TH0/TL0 and TH1/TL1). \\nTimer registers names; brief descriptions and addresses are given in \\nthe table below. \\nTimer 0 has two SFRs dedicated exclusively to itself: TH0 and TL0. \\nThose are high and low bytes of the timer. When Timer 0 has a value of \\n0, both TH0 and TL0 will contain 0. When Timer 0 has the value of for \\nexample 1000, TH0 will hold the high byte of the value (3 decimal) and \\nTL0 will contain the low byte of the value (232 decimal). The final value \\nof timer register is obtained by multiplying the high byte value by 256 \\nand adding the low byte value to this value: \\n  \\nTH0 256\\nTL0\\n1000\\n3 256\\n232\\n1000\\n×\\n+\\n=\\n×\\n+\\n=\\n \\n \\nTimer 1 is identical to Timer 0, but it’s SFRs are TH1 and TL1.'),\n",

Generally the 13-bit timer mode is not used in new development.  \\nWhen the timer is in 13-bit mode, TLx will count from 0 to 31. When TLx \\nis incremented from 31, it will \"reset\" to 0 and increment THx. Thus, \\neffectively, only 13 bits of the two timer bytes are being used: bits 0-4 of \\nTLx and bits 0-7 of THx. This also means, in essence, the timer can \\nonly contain 8192 values.

When TLx reaches 255 and is subsequently incremented, instead \\nof resetting to 0 (as in the case of modes 0 and 1), it will be reset to the \\nvalue stored in THx. \\nIn mode 2 THx is always set to a known value and TLx is the SFR that \\nis constantly incremented.  \\nIn this mode microcontroller hardware takes care of checking for the \\ntimer overfow and reloading of the timer, thus saving some of the \\nprocessing time.  \\nThe auto-reload mode is very commonly used for establishing a baud \\nrate necessary for the serial communications.'),\n",

ISR (interrupt service \\nroutine) is only executed when a certain event (interrupt) occurs. The \\nevent may be one of the timers \"overflowing,\" receiving a character via \\nthe serial port, transmitting a character via the serial port, or one of two \\n\"external events.\" The 8051 may be configured so that when any of \\nthese events occur the main program is temporarily suspended and \\ncontrol passed to a special section of code which would execute some \\nfunction related to the event that occurred. Once complete, control \\nwould be returned to the original program so that the main program \\nnever even knows it was interrupted. \\nThe ability to interrupt normal program execution when certain events \\noccur makes it much easier and much more efficient to handle certain \\nconditions. Without interrupts a manual check in the main program \\nwould have to be performed to establish whether the timers had \\noverflown, whether another character has been received via the serial \\nport, or if some external event had occurred. Besides making the main \\nprogram longer and more complicated to read and understand, more \\nimportantly, such a situation would make program inefficient since \\n\"instruction cycles\" would be spent checking for events that usually \\ndon’t happen or happen very infrequently during the program execution.  \\n \\nIt was shown in the previous handout how timer flag needs to be \\nchecked to detect timer overflow when generating accurate delay in the \\nprogram. This isn’t necessary. Interrupts let us forget about checking for \\nthe condition. The microcontroller itself will check for the condition \\nautomatically and when the condition is met will jump to a subroutine \\n(called an interrupt handler), execute the code, then return. \\n \\nInterrupt Events \\nThe 8051 family of microcontrollers can be configured to respond to \\ninterrupts caused by the following events: \\n \\n\\x83 \\nTimer 0 Overflow  \\n\\x83 \\nTimer 1 Overflow  \\n\\x83 \\nReception/Transmission of Serial Character  \\n\\x83 \\nExternal Event 0 \\n\\x83 \\nExternal Event 1  \\n \\nSo when, for example Timer 0 overflows or when a character is \\nsuccessfully sent or received via serial port, the appropriate interrupt \\nhandler routines are called and executed. It is necessary to distinguish \\nbetween various interrupts and to respond to them by executing \\ndifferent ISR. This is accomplished by jumping to a fixed address when \\na given interrupt occurs. These addresses are usually placed at the \\nbottom of the memory map, in the area of memory so called interrupt \\nvector table (IVT). \\n \\nInterrupt \\nName \\nISR Address \\nExternal 0 \\nIE0 \\n0003h \\nTimer 0 \\nTF0 \\n000Bh \\nExternal 1 \\nIE1 \\n0013h \\nTimer 1 \\nTF1 \\n001Bh \\nSerial \\nRI/TI \\n0023h \\n \\nFrom the above IVT it can be seen that whenever Timer 0 overflows \\n(i.e., the TF0 bit is set), the main program will be temporarily suspended \\nand control will jump to 000BH. It is of course necessary to have a code \\nat address 000BH that handles the situation of Timer 0 overflowing.'),\n",

Therefore even if, for \\nexample, the TF0 bit is set, the 8051 will not execute the interrupt.

Bit 7, the Global Interrupt \\nEnable/Disable, enables or disables all interrupts simultaneously. If bit 7 \\nis cleared then no interrupts will occur, even if all the other bits of IE are \\nset. Setting bit 7 will enable all the interrupts that have been selected by \\nsetting other bits in IE. This is useful in program executing time-critical \\ncode where it might be needed to execute code from start to finish \\nwithout any interrupt getting in the way. To accomplish this bit 7 of IE \\ncan simply be cleared (EA = 0;) and then set after the time-critical code \\nis done.

This \\nis due to the fact that there are two interrupt flags: RI and TI (bits 0 and \\n1 from SCON register). If either flag is set, a serial interrupt is triggered. \\nRI bit is set when a byte is received by the serial port and the TI bit is \\nset when a byte has been sent. This means that when serial interrupt \\noccurs, it may have been triggered because the RI flag was set or \\nbecause the TI flag was set-or because both flags were set.

It is very easy way to read and write values to the serial \\nport. If it were not for the integrated serial port, writing a byte to a serial \\nline would be a rather tedious process requiring turning on and off one \\nof the I/O lines in rapid succession to properly \"clock out\" each \\nindividual bit, including start bits, stop bits, and parity bits. \\nHowever, on 8051 this is not necessary. Instead, what is needed is to \\nconfigure the serial port’s operation mode and baud rate. Once this is \\nconfigured, writing to an appropriate SFR will write a value to the serial \\nport or reading the same SFR will read a value from the serial port. The \\n8051 will automatically signal when it has finished sending the \\ncharacter written to its SFR and will also signal when it has received a \\nbyte so that the program can process it further. Programmer does not \\nhave to worry about transmission at the bit level, which saves, quite a \\nbit of coding and processing time. \\n \\nSetting the Serial Port Mode \\nThe first thing to do when using the 8051’s integrated serial port is to \\nconfigure it. This informs the 8051 of how many data bits are to be \\ntransmitted or received, the baud rate to be used, and how the baud \\nrate will be determined.

The four modes are defined in the chart immediately above. \\nSelecting the Serial Mode selects the mode of operation (8-bit/9-bit, \\nUART or Shift Register) and also determines how the baud rate will be \\ncalculated. In modes 0 and 2 the baud rate is fixed based on the \\noscillator’s frequency. In modes 1 and 3 the baud rate is variable based \\non how often Timer 1 overflows. \\n \\nThe next bit, SM2, is a flag for \"Multiprocessor communication\". \\nGenerally, whenever a byte has been received the 8051 will set the \"RI\" \\n(Receive Interrupt) flag. This lets the program know that a byte has \\nbeen received and that it needs to be processed. However, when SM2 \\nis set the \"RI\" flag will only be triggered if the 9th bit received was a \"1\". \\nThat is to say, if SM2 is set and a byte is received whose 9th bit is \\nclear, the RI flag will never be set. This can be useful in certain \\nadvanced serial applications. For our applications it is safe to say that \\nthis bit needs to be cleared so that the flag is set upon reception of any \\ncharacter. \\n \\nThe next bit, REN, is \"Receiver Enable.\" This bit is very straightforward: \\nTo receive data via the serial port, this bit needs to be set. \\n  \\nThe last four bits (bits 0 through 3) are operational bits. They are used \\nwhen actually sending and receiving data, i.e. they are not used to \\nconfigure the serial port. \\n \\nThe TB8 bit is used in modes 2 and 3. In modes 2 and 3, a total of nine \\ndata bits are transmitted. The first 8 data bits are the 8 bits of the main \\nvalue, and the ninth bit is taken from TB8. If TB8 is set and a value is \\nwritten to the serial port, the data’s bits will be written to the serial line \\nfollowed by a \"set\" ninth bit. If TB8 is clear the ninth bit will be \"clear.\" \\nThe RB8 also operates in modes 2 and 3 and functions essentially the \\nsame way as TB8, but on the reception side. When a byte is received in \\nmodes 2 or 3, a total of nine bits are received. In this case, the first \\neight bits received are the data of the serial byte received and the value \\nof the ninth bit received will be placed in RB8. \\n \\nTI means \"Transmit Interrupt.\" When a program writes a value to the \\nserial port, a certain amount of time will pass before the individual bits \\nof the byte are \"clocked out\" the serial port. If the program were to write \\nanother byte to the serial port before the first byte was completely \\noutput, the data being sent would be overwritten and therefore lost for \\ntransmission. Thus, the 8051 lets the program know that it has \"clocked \\nout\" the last byte by setting the TI bit. When the TI bit is set, the \\nprogram may assume that the serial port is \"free\" and ready to send the \\nnext byte. \\n \\nFinally, the RI bit means \"Receive Interrupt.\" It functions similarly to the \\n\"TI\" bit, but it indicates that a byte has been received. Whenever the \\n8051 has received a complete byte it will trigger the RI bit to let the \\nprogram know that it needs to read the value quickly, before another \\nbyte is read. \\nSetting the Serial Port Baud Rate \\nOnce the Serial Port Mode has been configured, as explained above, \\nthe program must configure the serial port’s baud rate. This only applies \\nto Serial Port modes 1 and 3. The Baud Rate is determined based on \\nthe oscillator’s frequency when in mode 0 and 2. In mode 0, the baud \\nrate is always the oscillator frequency divided by 12. This means if the \\ncrystal is 11.059Mhz, mode 0 baud rate will always be 921,583 baud. In \\nmode 2 the baud rate is always the oscillator frequency divided by 64, \\nso a 11.059Mhz crystal speed will yield a baud rate of 172,797. In \\nmodes 1 and 3, the baud rate is determined by how frequently timer 1 \\noverflows. The more frequently timer 1 overflows, the higher the baud \\nrate. There are many ways to set timer 1 to overflow at a rate that \\ndetermines a baud rate, but the most common method is to put timer 1 \\nin 8-bit auto-reload mode (timer mode 2) and set a reload value (TH1) \\nthat causes Timer 1 to overflow at a frequency appropriate to generate \\na baud rate. To determine the value that must be placed in TH1 to \\ngenerate a given baud rate, we may use the following equation \\n(assuming PCON.7 is clear).'),\n",

The program will pause on \\nthe “while(!TI)” instruction until the TI bit is set by the 8051 upon \\nsuccessful transmission of the character. \\nReading the Serial Port \\nTo read a byte from the serial port the value stored in the SBUF (99h) \\nSFR needs to be read after the 8051 has automatically set the RI flag in \\nSCON. For example, if the program wants to wait for a character to be \\nreceived and subsequently read it into the a program variable, the \\nfollowing code segment may be used: \\n \\nwhile(!RI); // wait for 8051 to set the flag  \\nC = SBUF; \\n// read the character from the port \\nRI = 0;  \\n \\nThe first line of the above code segment waits for the 8051 to set the RI \\nflag; again, the 8051 sets the RI flag automatically when it receives a \\ncharacter via the serial port. So as long as the bit is not set the program \\nwaits on the \"while(!RI)\" instruction.
