Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that improves large language models (LLMs) by giving them access to up-to-date, external data sources. This process makes LLM-generated responses more accurate, context-specific, and reliable than those produced by the model's original, static training data alone. 
How RAG works
A RAG system follows a series of steps to generate a response for a user query: 
Ingestion: A knowledge base, which can contain a variety of data types like PDFs, databases, and websites, is created. An embedding model converts this data into numerical representations, called vectors, and stores them in a vector database.
Retrieval: When a user submits a query, the system uses a retriever model to search the vector database for the most relevant information.
Augmentation: The retrieved, contextual information is added to the user's original query to create an enhanced prompt.
Generation: The augmented prompt is sent to the large language model, which uses both its initial training data and the newly retrieved information to create a final, well-grounded response. 
Key benefits of using RAG
Reduces "hallucinations": Since RAG grounds responses in factual, external data, it significantly lowers the risk of the LLM presenting false or nonsensical information.
Provides up-to-date information: RAG systems can be updated continuously with fresh information without the need for expensive and time-consuming model retraining.
Adds domain-specific knowledge: Companies can connect LLMs to their own internal documents, product manuals, or policies, enabling them to produce more specialized and relevant answers.
Builds user trust: RAG allows the model to cite its sources, giving users the ability to verify the information for themselves.
Increases cost efficiency: Organizations can improve the performance of a foundational model for specific tasks by using RAG, which is far less expensive than fine-tuning or retraining the entire LLM. 
Common RAG applications
Customer service chatbots: A chatbot can provide specific, up-to-date information by referencing a company's internal knowledge base and product manuals.
Research assistants: RAG can help financial analysts, medical professionals, and other researchers quickly access and synthesize information from vast databases of records, journals, and reports.
Internal knowledge management: Employees can query an organization's documents using conversational language to find actionable insights, streamline onboarding, or get HR support.
Content generation: The technology can be used to gather information from multiple authoritative sources and generate more reliable articles or summaries.
