🚀 Project Name: AutoMind-X
5G-Enabled Agentic AI Ecosystem for Autonomous Predictive Maintenance
🌍 Project Vision

AutoMind-X is a next-generation AI system that makes vehicles self-aware, predictive, and proactive.
Instead of waiting for a breakdown, the vehicle predicts faults in advance, communicates with the user, and books service automatically — all through a network of AI agents running on 5G connectivity with blockchain security.

Think of it as your vehicle’s digital brain, continuously learning, talking, and improving — making maintenance intelligent, secure, and sustainable.

⚠️ Problem Background

Today’s automotive maintenance is reactive:

Vehicles fail unexpectedly — causing downtime and costly repairs.

Users notice problems only when performance drops.

Workshops handle unpredictable load.

Manufacturers don’t get real-time field data for product improvement.

Maintenance data is fragmented and insecure.

This causes loss of time, revenue, and trust.

💡 Solution: AutoMind-X

AutoMind-X builds a multi-agent AI ecosystem that:

Continuously monitors vehicle sensors (IoT/OBD-II).

Predicts upcoming faults using AI models.

Explains the reason for the prediction (Explainable AI).

Interacts with the user through chat or voice.

Auto-books a service appointment.

Secures every transaction using blockchain + UEBA (AI behavior monitoring).

Learns from every repair to improve itself and the vehicle model.

This system transforms vehicle maintenance from reactive → predictive → autonomous.

🧠 Core Components Explained
1️⃣ Edge Agent (Vehicle Side)

Runs on ECU / Raspberry Pi.

Reads sensors: engine temperature, RPM, oil pressure, GPS, vibration.

Uses threshold detection & lightweight ML (e.g., Z-score anomaly).

Sends JSON telemetry every few seconds via MQTT over 5G.

Example Data:

{
  "vehicle_id":"HR12AB1234",
  "engine_temp":112,
  "oil_pressure":1.1,
  "vibration":0.7,
  "rpm":3400,
  "timestamp":"2025-10-25T12:30:00Z"
}

2️⃣ Master Agent

The brain of AutoMind-X.

Receives data streams.

Decides which worker agents to activate.

Merges outputs and logs events.

Communicates with the blockchain layer.

Coordinates responses between all agents.

3️⃣ Worker Agents
Agent	Description
Data Analysis Agent	Checks patterns, applies moving averages, detects trends.
Predictive Model Agent	Runs LSTM for time-series (temperature, vibration) + CNN for audio signals → predicts fault probability.
Diagnosis Agent	Maps predictions to human-readable issues; explains cause using SHAP (e.g., “Coolant temp rising by +15°C every 5 min → radiator pump wear likely”).
Customer Engagement Agent	Talks with the user via chat or voice (Whisper/gTTS). Gets confirmation for booking.
Scheduling Agent	Finds nearest service center & free slot via REST API, confirms booking, returns booking ID.
Digital Twin Agent	Maintains virtual model of vehicle health; visualizes wear level for every subsystem.
Manufacturing Insights Agent	Aggregates faults from multiple vehicles → detects supplier or design issues.
UEBA Agent	Monitors all inter-agent activity, flags abnormal or unauthorized data access.
4️⃣ Blockchain Layer

Every critical event (fault detection, booking, model retrain) gets hashed.

Stored on private Ethereum testnet (Ganache).

Ensures auditability, immutability, and trust.

Each log: { event, agent, timestamp, payload_hash }.

5️⃣ Visualization Layer

Built with Streamlit or Grafana, showing:

Vehicle health scores (color-coded).

Upcoming predicted failures.

Real-time bookings & maintenance schedule.

UEBA security events.

Environmental impact dashboard (fuel & CO₂ trends).

🔄 End-to-End Flow

Data Generation: Sensors send telemetry → Edge Agent preprocesses.

Data Transfer: Sent securely via 5G network to the cloud.

Analysis: Master Agent triggers Data & Predictive Agents.

Prediction: AI model outputs component failure probabilities.

Diagnosis: Converts output to clear, explainable message.

Engagement: AI contacts the owner (chat/voice).

Scheduling: Slot booked; confirmation returned.

Logging: Event recorded on blockchain; UEBA tracks agent access.

Service: Technician verifies fault & uploads repair result.

Feedback: Data fed back to retrain models & update digital twin.

Manufacturing Insights: Fleet data analyzed for common faults → CAPA suggestions.

🧮 Predictive Modeling (AI Logic)
LSTM Model

Inputs: last 60 telemetry readings (10-min window).

Output: Probability of component failure in next 24 hours.

Trained on synthetic dataset (normal vs faulty sensor curves).

CNN Model (for Acoustic)

Inputs: mel-spectrograms from engine sound.

Output: Fault class (normal / knock / misfire / leak).

Fusion

Combine LSTM + CNN outputs with weighted average.

Generate “Health Score” and “Risk Index”.

🔐 Security System (UEBA + Blockchain)
UEBA

Collects all agent logs.

Learns normal patterns (who calls whom, when, frequency).

Flags anomalies like:

Unauthorized DB read/write.

Abnormally high request frequency.

New agent behavior not seen before.

Example alert:

{
  "agent":"SchedulingAgent",
  "event":"unexpected database access",
  "score":0.93,
  "timestamp":"2025-10-25T11:24:00Z"
}

Blockchain

Hashes each critical log (SHA-256).

Sends to Ethereum testnet using web3.py.

Prevents tampering and ensures trust.

🌿 Sustainability Analytics

Tracks how maintenance affects efficiency (fuel vs wear).

Estimates CO₂ saved due to proactive service.

Adds “Eco Score” per vehicle in dashboard.

Supports future “Green Maintenance” campaigns.
